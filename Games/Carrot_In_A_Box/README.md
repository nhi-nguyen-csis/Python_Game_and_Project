### Game Rule
A game of bluff. Who has the carrot? Winner takes all.

### How to Play:
2 contestants, each has a box

Ask them who wants to go first or choose one to go first.

Contestant A looks in their own box. Without showing it to contestant B. 
Contestant A gets to say whether they want to keep their box or exchange 
it with the other box. If they want to exchange it - switch the boxes.

Contestant B now gets to decide if they want to keep the box they're left 
with or exchange it for their original. Contestant B is not allowed to look 
in either of the boxes.
