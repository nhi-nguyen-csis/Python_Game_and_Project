### Game Rule
A game of bluff. Who has the carrot? Winner takes all.

### How to Play:
2 contestants, each has a box, but there's only 1 carrot in either of the boxes

Roll a dice to decide who goes first. Whoever goes first chooses to open one of the boxes

Contestant A looks in their own box. Without showing it to contestant B. 
Contestant A gets to say whether they want to keep their box or exchange 
it with the other box. If they want to exchange it - switch the boxes.
