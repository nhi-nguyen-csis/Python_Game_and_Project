### Game Rule

The game uses two standard six-sided dice, which are shaken in a bamboo cup or bowl by a dealer. 
The cup is then overturned onto the floor. Players then place their wagers on whether the sum 
total of numbers showing on the two dice will be "Ch≈ç" (even) or "Han" (odd). The dealer 
then removes the cup, displaying the dice. The winners collect their money.
