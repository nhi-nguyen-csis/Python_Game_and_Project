### This project followed the instructions from 'Automate The Boring Stuff With Python'

I didn't use Python `datetime` library to generate the random birthdate and birth month like
the book does. Instead, I generate the random birthday by using a `dictionary` (It probably runs
slower than using the API), but it still works as I expected :)
