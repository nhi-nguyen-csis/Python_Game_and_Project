### This project is from "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python"

Here are some notes:

- We assume that Caesar cipher only works on uppercase letters, and 
it encrypts/decrypts alphabetical letters only. Thus, we use 
a brute force approach to search for 26 posibilities and print them all

- I use modulus to handle the wrap-around for decrypting the message in the program
